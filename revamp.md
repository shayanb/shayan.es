This is my personal professional website which I made years ago using Jekyll. I've used it as resume and portfolio of papers, etc. I'm thinking of revamping it to make it more modern and visually appealing, while also making it easier to navigate and find information. Additioanlly I want the look and the feel of the website to be more personal and reflect my personality, while still being professional.
The current website is at https://shayan.es . 


The idea is to revamp it as it's been cluttered with to many things in one page, and this needs to be multiple pages and more impressive.

You can learn what exists in the data folder mainly, ideally we can keep the jekyll structure, but open to new ideas.


There are other sections I want to add:
- Hackathons I've participated in as Judge, Mentor, and hacker, with info like date, location, project, winnings, etc.
- Conferences I've attended, with info like date, location, talks, etc.
- App's I've built, with info like date, platform, description, etc.
- Projects I've worked on. It exists in one section in the current website but there are many other projects that I want to add. this can be an extension of the Apps section or a separate as projects might not be apps. 
- artistic works I've done, like pictures of the art i've created, analogue photos (links to instagram possible?)

things to consider:
- The website should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- dark mode support (but can be added later)
- easy to navigate with a clear menu structure

Claude response:


Now let me create a comprehensive plan for your website revamp:
  ⎿  ☐ Create multi-page navigation structure with clear menu system
     ☐ Design new homepage that serves as an engaging landing page
     ☐ Create dedicated pages for each major section (About, Projects, Publications, etc.)
     ☐ Add new data files for Hackathons, Conferences, Apps, and Artistic Works
     ☐ Design unique layouts for different content types to avoid visual monotony
     ☐ Implement modern design elements (animations, transitions, interactive components)
     ☐ Create a portfolio/gallery layout for artistic works
     ☐ Improve mobile navigation with hamburger menu or similar
     ☐ Add personal touches (custom typography, color scheme, micro-interactions)
     ☐ Implement dark mode support

✻ Thinking…

  Now I should ask clarifying questions to better understand the user's vision and preferences before 
  starting to code.

⏺ Before I start coding, I have some questions to ensure the revamp aligns with your vision:

  Design & Personality Questions:

  1. Visual Style: What design aesthetic appeals to you? (minimalist, bold/colorful, elegant/sophisticated,
  playful/creative, tech-forward?)
  2. Color Preferences: Any specific colors that represent your personality or brand?
  3. Typography: Do you prefer modern sans-serif, classic serif, or mixed typography?
  4. Personal Elements: What aspects of your personality should shine through? (innovative, approachable,
  technical expertise, creative side?)

  Content & Structure Questions:

  1. Homepage Vision: Should it be a brief overview with calls-to-action, a visual portfolio, or an
  interactive experience?
  2. Priority Sections: Which 3-5 sections are most important to highlight?
  3. Hackathons Data: What specific info do you want to track? (project name, team size, tech stack, awards,
  your role?)
  4. Apps Section: Should this showcase screenshots/demos, or be more description-focused?
  5. Artistic Works: Do you want a full gallery, or selected highlights? Instagram integration priority?

  Technical Questions:

  1. Animation Preference: Subtle micro-interactions or more dramatic transitions?
  2. Navigation Style: Traditional header menu, side navigation, or something more creative?
  3. Performance vs Visual: Prioritize fast loading or rich visuals?
  4. Jekyll Plugins: Open to using Jekyll plugins for enhanced functionality?

  Inspiration:

  Are there any websites whose design or functionality you admire that I should consider as inspiration?

Response:

1. visual style: I prefer a minimalist and elegant design that is sophisticated but not overly complex. Easter eggs (playful/creative) are welcome, tech-forward elements are also appreciated.
2. color preference: I like clean, matte colors. Like for clothing, I like black with red snips or threads, or like orange on blue. but not sure if those are well suited for a website. Current website is green, grey and while but I'm open to changing the color scheme.
3. typography: I'm open to mixing in some serif fonts for headings or special sections.
4. personal elements: I want to convey a sense of innovation, approachability, and technical expertise, while also showcasing my creative side.

Content & Structure Questions:
1. homepage vision: I envision a brief overview with clear calls-to-action that lead to the main sections, and perhaps visual elements that indicate the sections without overwhelming the user.
2. priority sections: Publications, careers (past jobs and current), lectures and talks, links to other profiles, education, projects and apps, etc
3. hackathons data: hackathon name, date, location, my role (judge, mentor, hacker). in case of hacker, project name, link to the project, and any winnings or awards.
4. App sections: maybe desciption focused with their logos, and then click to open the module with more details and screenshots if available.
5. artistic works:  selected highlights with a smooth gallery layout, Instagram integration is a nice-to-have.


Technical Questions:
1. animation preference: subtle micro-interactions and transitions
2. the header menu (with hamburger menu for mobile) and side navigation for subsections. If you have creative ideas suggest and ask me.
3. performance vs visual: somewhere balanced
4. Jekyll plugins: yes.

Design Details:

  1. Color Scheme Options - Which appeals more to you?
    - Option A: Black/charcoal base with vibrant red accents (like a red thread on black fabric)
    - Option B: Deep blue base with electric orange accents
    - Option C: Keep it neutral with grays but add one bold accent color
  2. Homepage Hero Section:
    - Would you like an animated typing effect with rotating titles (e.g., "Security Researcher", "Software
  Engineer", "Creative Technologist")?
    - Or a more static but elegant introduction with your name and a brief tagline?
  3. Section Cards on Homepage:
    - Interactive cards that reveal a preview on hover?
    - Or clean, minimal cards with just icons and titles?
  4. Easter Eggs Ideas:
    - Konami code that triggers a fun animation?
    - Hidden ASCII art in the console?
    - Subtle animations when clicking certain elements?
    - Terminal-style command palette (ctrl+k)?
  5. Projects/Apps Organization:
    - Should "Apps" be a subsection under "Projects" or completely separate?
    - For the expandable details, would you prefer a modal popup or inline expansion?
  6. Social Links Display:
    - Floating social bar?
    - Footer integration?
    - Or a dedicated "Connect" page with all your profiles?

-=--------------------------------

response:


1. Color Scheme: Option B, but make sure it's not too dark, and it looks professional and elegant. (not too funky)
2. Homepage Hero section: Elegant introduction with my name and a brief tagline, with a subtle animation.
3. Section Cards: Minimal Cards with icon and title, but with a hover effect that reveals more details.
4. Easter Eggs Ideas: Konami code that triggers a fun animation (slightly nerdy but NSFW), for sure hidden ascii art in the console. leave this for the end of the todo list after everything else is done to implement a subtle animations when clicking certain elements. 
5. Projects/Apps Organization: let's keep the separate. Apps will less details but more links, projects will have more technical details and maybe no pictures (but some can have). Modal popup for the expandable details.
6. Social Links Display: Floating social bar, all links in the footer, and a dedicated "Connect" page with all my profiles (with animated icons of the platforms and a line or two in the front.).

Fix these:
- the fontawesome icons are not showing up on the local server (exising problem from before), why? can we fix this?

Home page:
- Recent highlights should be clickable to jump to the correct section (and open the modal). make them either show the latest 2 updates in each section, or create a yaml file to customize them

Publications:
- bring publications-stats up in the page, if you can integrate google scholar numbers (like the number of citations) it'll be awesome.
- make the published in to be under the title to the right. and more visible, also clickable. 
- make sure if there are media talks from the previous yaml format you integrate them here as 
- well. (this should be done for all other sections)


Projects:
- can we make the cards to be on the same size? consistent
- the media links are showing weirdly
- add year to the projects too (ideally a way to add start end, or just one offs)

Apps:
- remove the fake added projects, here are a list my projects to add:
  - PadSnap: Image Resize & Padding Tool 🎞️ 📸 : https://padsnap.app
  - ethduties: Ethereum validator Duties Tracker: https://ethduti.es/
  - EtherTrip: Psychedelic Ethereum Galaxy Visualizer : https://github.com/shayanb/EtherTrip
  - Ethereum Validator Staking Rewards Calculator (Pectra Edition): https://shayanb.github.io/EIP-7251-calcualator/
  - Interactive web application to create and visualize timelines.: https://shayanb.github.io/timeline/


Career:
- Add description to the jobs.
- ideally we can add the company logos that will be on the left bottom corner of their cards
- bring the Professional Highlights to the top of the lists with each clickable to go to the right page.


Talks:
- Add the proper links top the talks (youtube, slides, etc what ever exist in the old yaml files). add the conference title (with link), date, etc to the same card in a visually nice way.
- add an image to be added to the top of the cards (screenshot of youtube maybe)
- bring the speaking overview to the top with links to each section
- merge the conference presentation with the academic talks


Connect:
- use all the websites/profiles that are filled in the old config.yml file 


No Art/portfolio page exists.

go through your todo and make sure everything is implemented.
