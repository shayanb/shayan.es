    description: "Bitcoin is a digital money, meaning it's Digital, simple. It is based on 0 and 1s, as they say. A more efficient way of showing 0 and 1s is by using their hexadecimal representation a.k.a base 16. <br><br> All historical data of all Bitcoin transactions ever happened are stored in a big database called 'Blockchain', and that is because these hexadecimal numbers are grouped together in batches called 'block' and appended to the previous data on the database with a cryptographic method to prove the order and sanity, so basically a chain, a Blockchain. <br><br> Everyone running a Bitcoin full node, have a fully secure copy of this database. It’s just like torrent, when you download a linux image, you actually connect to some other computers and download the file from them, a peer to peer connection. So when you run Bitcoin software on your computer, It starts downloading that database and verify all the blocks, one by one, to make sure it’s a legit copy that everyone else have. <br> That is the basics of Bitcoin. <br><br> Transaction hash: <a href='https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/7f2875779f2429ee76e50857c6407e56ecc5ba7b0c9cfb102a477e50072233fa' target='_blank'>7f2875779f2429ee76e50857c6407e56ecc5ba7b0c9cfb102a477e50072233fa</a>"
