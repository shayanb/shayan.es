- name: Cryptojacking, victimless crime or a new online economy?
  descr: "Cryptojacking is the invisible use of one’s resources to mine cryptocurrency for someone else’s profit. Even though these attacks rose by 8500 percent in the final quarter of 2017, it seems that this phenomena is neither well-studied or well-known. In the follow up of the published paper, we invite the community from crypto-communities to ethicists to start the conversation on the policies and regulation for this new online monetization architecture."
