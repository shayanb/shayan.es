- name: "Security By Design and Smart Contract Audits"
  descr: "This session will cover why smart contracts are the new paradigm of software development. The idea of a serverless application running in a public ledger with open interface is new to most developers and hence common practices in traditional programming could easily result in security vulnerabilities in decentralized applications. The second half of the session will focus on smart contract code auditing and hands on code review on real smart contracts."

  descr: "Blockchain and DLT based systems are waiting in the wings to join the potpourri of core technology that makes up our future digital lives. Both core internet infrastructure technology and many DLT solutions have one thing in common: They are developed with a diverse open source developer community and carry significant security risk. To manage software change related risks both Bitcoin and Ethereum have derived their own process of managing change proposals. For Ethereum changes are discussed and agreed upon in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. However given the non-hierarchy management model, there have been many approaches and obstacles to make this process as close to a democratic procedure as possible. It is working, but far from perfect and there are many good approaches and lessons learnt. EIP requires input from experts at IETF to shape up and standardize."

  descr: "Cryptojacking is the invisible use of one’s resources to mine cryptocurrency for someone else’s profit. Even though these attacks rose by 8500 percent in the final quarter of 2017, it seems that this phenomena is neither well-studied or well-known. In the follow up of the published paper, we invite the community from crypto-communities to ethicists to start the conversation on the policies and regulation for this new online monetization architecture."
